# C++ vs. Python

1. Nature and Design:
   - **C++**: It's a `statically-typed`, compiled language.
   
    - Python: It's a `dynamically-typed`, interpreted language.

2. Memory Management:
   - **C++**: Developers have direct control over memory management using pointers, new, and delete. 
    - **Python**: Uses automatic garbage collection, so developers don't need to manage memory explicitly.

3. Integration:
   - **C++**: Can be integrated with other languages using various mechanisms, including the `C Foreign Function Interface` (FFI).
   - **Python**: Can be easily integrated with C/C++ using tools like ctypes, cffi, or Cython. This allows Python to leverage high-performance C/C++ code when needed.

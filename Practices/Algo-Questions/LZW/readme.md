# LZW Encoder and Decoder

## Overview
This program implements the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm for lossless data compression and decompression. The LZW algorithm is widely used in computer science and information theory for its efficiency in compressing a variety of data types. The implementation is written in C++ and includes a random string generator for testing purposes.

## Features
- **LZW Encoding**: Compresses input strings into a series of codes representing substrings.
- **LZW Decoding**: Decompresses the series of codes back into the original string.
- **Random String Generator**: Generates random strings consisting of uppercase letters for testing the encoder and decoder.

## Classes
- `LZWEncoder`: Handles the encoding process.
- `LZWDncoder`: Handles the decoding process.

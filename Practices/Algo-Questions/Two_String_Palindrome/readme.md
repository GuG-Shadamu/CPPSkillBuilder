# Questions

Given two strings, first, find out all palindrome possible for string a and find out all palindrome possible for string b. Second, from the longest palindrome of string a and string b with the smallest Lexi-graphical order, form a longest palindrome and return it. If both palindrome are of odd lengths, you can only pick one letter from the middle of either palindrome.

## Examples


- String a = "abaa"; String b = "ccca"
- Palindromes for a: [aaa, aba]
- Palindromes for b: [cac, ccc]
- Longest palindromes: aaa (from a), ccc (from b)
- Formed palindrome: aaccaa
